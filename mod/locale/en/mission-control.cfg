[entity-description]
mission-control-tower=A communications tower that aggregates circuit signals from all Mission Control Towers on the same surface and broadcasts them to orbiting space platforms. Outputs signals received from platforms.
receiver-combinator=A space platform combinator that receives circuit signals from planetary Mission Control Towers when orbiting configured surfaces. Sends platform signals back to the surface.

[item-description]
mission-control-tower=Enables ground-to-space circuit network communication. All towers on the same surface share their input signals and broadcast to orbiting platforms. Can only be placed on planetary surfaces.
receiver-combinator=Enables space-to-ground circuit network communication. Configure which surfaces to connect to when orbiting. Can only be placed on space platforms.

[technology-name]
mission-control=Mission Control

[technology-description]
mission-control=Unlocks Mission Control Towers and Receiver Combinators, enabling circuit network communication between planetary surfaces and orbiting space platforms. This allows for remote monitoring and control of cross-surface operations.
