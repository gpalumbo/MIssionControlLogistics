[entity-description]
mission-control-tower=A communications tower that aggregates circuit signals from all Mission Control Towers on the same surface and broadcasts them to orbiting space platforms. Outputs signals received from platforms.
receiver-combinator=A space platform combinator that receives circuit signals from planetary Mission Control Towers when orbiting configured surfaces. Sends platform signals back to the surface.
